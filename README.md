## Overview
The task was to build a URL shortener using shrtcode API, where users can enter a valid URL and have it shortened.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process
My approach to this challenge was first tinker with the shrtcode API and learn how to properly fetch data from it and how to make use of said data. I then went ahead to work on the functionality of the page(how to make the request and display the shortened links), before I worked on the design based on the design files
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The major thing I learnt from this project is how to make use of the clipboard API, and how to fetch and make use of API requests.

### Continued development

I believe I need to work on the knowledge in manipulating dynamically rendered DOM elements, like the ones I used in my #display div
